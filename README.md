# Frame

Going beyond Scientific Method and open sourcing Truth.

The Scientific Method is one of the greatest inventions of humankind.
This project aim is to go even beyond.

The goal is to create a general process and platform that:

- **is easily applicable to almost any topic and question**
  - from how physics works
  - what pie is best
  - to purpose of life
- **results in humanities best approximation of the _Truth_**
  - sometimes we may find the answer
  - but sometimes a list of all options and their consequences is the best we can do
  - but a process that doesn't go back will always move forward, if possible
- **is extremely hard to manipulate**
  - logical or statistical errors can be spotted
  - bribing everyone around the world is too expensive
  - all lies must be made consistent and hold up to scrutiny, but Truth always will
- **is usable by most people**
  - everybody can use the results
  - anybody can follow the steps
  - anybody can contribute to the platform
- **is trusted and reliable**
  - the process must be shown to work
  - the process must be easy to understand
  - nobody can be trusted, but process always needs to work

## The idea

This framework is decomposed into 4 parts: the **Frame**, and the **Process**.

Additionally, the project wants to create a platform and a language.

### The Frame:

The Frame is versioned (there can be multiple versions), and is constant (every change creates a different version).

First, we create a ranking of different type of arguments and information on how trusted they can be. This ranking is then static and may ONLY change with different versions of the method. This ranking can be multidimensional and not a proper ordering.

Then we decide on a way for presenting arguments and their classification.

Finally, we create a set of rules for pointing out flaws, arguing, and improving the presented arguments.

### The Process:

On the other hand, the Process is based on a single version of a Frame. Changing to a different version requires redoing all the work (often nothing will need to be done, but some changes can completely break the process).

### The Platform:

To make it even simpler, one of the project aims is to create a platform that will automate the process as much as possible and present its result in the most useful way that is currently known.

Additionally, the platform could be used to collect and catalog useful explanations, instructions, and facts.

### The Language:

To enable automation without giving up clarity and simplicity, we are developing a language for modeling relationships, rules, processes, systems.

### Versioning:

Each Frame will have a unique identifier similar to `Frame v11.15.23a`, where:
- `Frame` is a human-readable name (could be anything)
- `11` is a major version number [breaking changes]
- `15` is a minor version number [adding new things]
- `23` is a patch version number [small patches]
- `a` means _alpha_ and is a version designation [a-alpha, b-beta, r-release]

The versions of Frames may change rapidly in the early stages, but should remain reasonable stable once at least one practical is found.

## How to participate:

Check out current newest version: [frame_v0.0.0a.md](v0.0.0a/frame_v0.0.0a.md)

Currently, we are just setting up. Most of the communication is currently done using private server on Discord before the platform will be created.
